# 🎓 **GradeExpress - An Automatic Grade Generation and Student & Faculty Management of Online Courses**

## 📌 **Status: Under Work (A few changes undergoing)**
Now, we are at the stage where we need a system that can automate the grading process and consume very little time. 
The main objective of this proposed system, named **EXPRESS GRADER**, is to automate all the processes and collect the required data at the click of a button. This can be achieved by just uploading the certificates of the students.

## 📌 **Why GradeExpress?**  
We are developing GradeExpress specifically for the purpose of credit transfer for NPTEL courses in our college.

### **Problems We Address:**
1. Grading and maintaining large sets of data in Excel sheets require a lot of manual effort and are not secure, as data may be lost at any point.
2. Need to fasten the grading process and grade acceptance for students to plan for the next semester courses.
3. An interface to display students' completed courses and their certificates.
4. OD list allocation for registered students of the course.
5. Student-tutor interaction and visibility into students' completed certifications.

### **Features:**
1. Secure verification and validation of students' certificates before grading.
2. All data is securely maintained with a backup in the backend.
3. A list of all courses available for eligible students.
4. Staff can easily notify students about department-supported courses.
